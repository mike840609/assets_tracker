# Asset Tracker — Bundle Analysis

## Overview

We leveraged `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect the client, server, and edge bundles produced by the Next.js Turbopack/Webpack build. Below is a breakdown of actionable suggestions designed to reduce initial bundle delivery size and improve load performance (specifically aiming to improve LCP, FCP, and TTFB).

| # | Suggestion | Category | Impact | Effort | Status |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| B1 | Ensure `@prisma/client` and `@neondatabase/serverless` are strictly server-only | Bundle Size | 🔴 High | 15 min | ❌ Not Done |
| B2 | Dynamic Import `AllocationChart` & `CurrencyExposureChart` | Bundle Size | 🔴 High | 30 min | ❌ Not Done |
| B3 | Inspect `date-fns` usage for tree-shaking | Bundle Size | 🟡 Medium | 30 min | ❌ Not Done |
| B4 | Audit `lucide-react` usage | Bundle Size | 🟡 Medium | 15 min | ❌ Not Done |
| B5 | Monitor `recharts` library payload | Bundle Size | 🟡 Medium | 45 min | ❌ Not Done |
| B6 | Lazy-load `sonner` Toaster | Bundle Size | 🟡 Medium | 15 min | ❌ Not Done |
| B7 | Restrict `zod` to Server Actions/API routes | Bundle Size | 🔴 High | 1 hr | ❌ Not Done |
| B8 | Opt-out `yahoo-finance2` from client bundle via `server-only` | Bundle Size | 🔴 High | 15 min | ❌ Not Done |
| B9 | Evaluate `next-intl` dictionary loading per route | Bundle Size | 🟡 Medium | 30 min | ❌ Not Done |
| B10 | Migrate `swr` fetching to RSCs (Server Components) | Bundle Size | 🟡 Medium | 1 hr | ❌ Not Done |

## Methodology

Findings sourced from running `@next/bundle-analyzer` against the project locally on **2026-04-20**:
- Client bundle (`.next/analyze/client.html`) ~609 KB compiled.
- NodeJS bundle (`.next/analyze/nodejs.html`) ~866 KB compiled.
- Edge bundle (`.next/analyze/edge.html`) ~290 KB compiled.

## Detailed Enhancement Write-ups

### B1 — Strict Server-Only Boundaries

**Observation.** Huge packages such as `@prisma/client` and other database-related dependencies (e.g., `@neondatabase/serverless` or authentication adapters) take up a massive amount of space when bundled. Wait for client payloads to include them inadvertently if they leak into `use client` components.

**Recommendation.** Use the `server-only` package to explicitly reject imports of `prisma` utilities from client components. Create a hard barrier to ensure these never slip into the `.next/analyze/client.html` bundle.

**Critical files:**
- `src/lib/prisma.ts`
- Missing `npm i server-only`

---

### B2 — Dynamic-import Sibling Dashboard Charts

**Observation.** While `TrendChart` is dynamically imported in `src/components/dashboard/lazy-charts.tsx`, the `AllocationChart` and `CurrencyExposureChart` widgets might be eagerly loaded into the initial dashboard payload. This drags down FCP / LCP for the dashboard. 

**Recommendation.** 
Convert static imports to `next/dynamic` ones with suspense fallbacks, avoiding loading `recharts` overhead before it's needed or while off-screen.

**Critical files:**
- `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/lazy-charts.tsx`

---

### B3 — Inspect `date-fns` Usage

**Observation.** Currently `date-fns` is optimized via `optimizePackageImports` in `next.config.ts`, but it's important to verify inside the analyzer HTML trace whether it's compiling precisely only the utilized functions (`format`, `subDays`, etc.) and not bundling unused locales.

**Recommendation.** Review all date manipulations. Next.js 16 should resolve this out of the box with `optimizePackageImports`, but verifying the emitted node limits is recommended. Replace with lighter alternatives like `Intl.DateTimeFormat` natively if the load remains significant.

**Critical files:**
- Files under `src/components/**` importing `date-fns`.

---

### B4 — Audit `lucide-react` Usage

**Observation.** Like `date-fns` and `recharts`, `lucide-react` is placed in `next.config.ts`'s experimental `optimizePackageImports`. The bundle analyzer can verify if only the specific SVG icons used are injected into the client bundle payload instead of the full library index.

**Recommendation.** Double check the `.next/analyze/client.html` bundle tree visually to confirm `lucide-react` leaf nodes are the only things being compiled into the Webpack chunks.

**Critical files:**
- `next.config.ts`

---

### B5 — Recharts Payload Overhead

**Observation.** Recharts generally adds a large (~120-150KB) chunk size to whatever client-side boundary involves it. By making it dynamically imported (B2), this chunk should sit separately (`chunk-...`). However, its presence still affects TTI (Time to Interactive).

**Recommendation.** Verify whether the charts are strictly necessary on mobile breakpoints or if they can be conditionally loaded/rendered based on viewport. 

**Critical files:**
- `src/components/dashboard/lazy-charts.tsx`

---

### B6 — Lazy-load `sonner` Toaster

**Observation.** Global toast libraries like `sonner` are often loaded at the root `<html />` layout level, pushing its bundle size unconditionally to all pages even if no toast is triggered on the initial load.

**Recommendation.** Use Next.js `next/dynamic` to dynamically import the `<Toaster />` component so it does not block the main thread and is only fetched when the client-side app eventually needs to use it.

**Critical files:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx`

---

### B7 — Restrict `zod` to Server boundaries

**Observation.** `zod` is a fantastic schema validation library, but its bundle size is around ~15KB (min+gzip). Having it ship to the client for form validations introduces noticeable overhead.

**Recommendation.** Shift all form validation and schema parsing to Next.js Server Actions using `zod`, completely dropping the library from the client-side chunk. If client validation is absolutely required to prevent network trips, consider evaluating leaner libraries (e.g. `valibot`).

**Critical files:**
- `src/components/**/holding-form.tsx` (and other forms)
- `package.json`

---

### B8 — Opt-out `yahoo-finance2` via `server-only`

**Observation.** Similar to the `@prisma/client` issue, `yahoo-finance2` handles financial requests heavily and has dependencies. It is meant to be Server-Only.

**Recommendation.** Verify that the `price-service.ts` or components leveraging `yahoo-finance2` are strictly marked with `'server-only'` to guarantee that no Next.js boundary leaks this entire SDK and its node-fetch fallbacks into the client chunk.

**Critical files:**
- `src/lib/services/price-service.ts`

---

### B9 — Evaluate `next-intl` dictionary loading

**Observation.** `next-intl` can bloat the client payload if the whole `en-US.json` or other active locales are loaded en-masse into the page props, regardless of how much text is actually needed by the rendered view.

**Recommendation.** Ensure the setup uses Server Components to parse and pass only the needed translation chunks to Client Components, rather than wrapping the entire app in `NextIntlClientProvider` with the complete JSON object loaded in the namespace.

**Critical files:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/i18n/request.ts`

---

### B10 — Migrate `swr` to RSC

**Observation.** The `swr` library provides client-side data fetching but requires bundling the fetching logic, state management, and the `swr` engine itself.

**Recommendation.** Take advantage of Next.js 16 Server Components and `use cache`. Moving data-fetching from the client (`useSWR`) to a server `await fetch(...)` natively eliminates the client-side library chunk completely while providing faster TTFB and SEO tracking natively.

**Critical files:**
- Client components currently using SWR Hooks
